# How to create a mod

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/91921f05-251a-4f1e-a2e9-d1e5bdd853d3)





# Configuration

**Add ModLib.dll to your project**

- Download ModLib, build and reference .dll to your project.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9554b89d-61c6-4ef5-9bad-97c3c62107ab)

**Add ModMain-BuildEvent**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75dee2aa-088a-4617-9257-8535e880dfd5)

`
rd "$(ProjectDir)obj" /s /q
rd "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\..\debug\Mod_nE7UL2\ModCode\dll" /s /q
rd "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\..\debug\Mod_nE7UL2\ModConf" /s /q
rd "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\..\debug\Mod_nE7UL2\ModImg" /s /q
xcopy "$(ProjectDir)\bin\Release\*.dll" "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\..\debug\Mod_nE7UL2\ModCode\dll\" /y /i
xcopy "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\ModConf\*.*" "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\..\debug\Mod_nE7UL2\ModConf\" /y /i
xcopy "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\ModConf\*.*" "$(ProjectDir)\..\..\..\debug\Mod_nE7UL2\ModImg\" /y /i
`

Add BuildEvent for copying dll to "debug" folder. (About `ModConf` and `ModImg`, remove it if you dont have any)

‚Äª"nE7UL2" is my mod-id. You should change "nE7UL2" to your mod-id. And build by "Release" mode.

‚ÄªYou should change MelonLoader folder path in `ModLib.csproj` and `ModMain.csproj` to use game dll.





# How to use

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34a75a28-38df-4922-aa43-732b8ab3b035)

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/84f35501-d6f2-4b8d-9cd6-2606bf397e59)

ÔºëÔºéJust inherit **ModChild** and config your mod. And then, you can use declared on-events.

‚ÄªCache id of ModChild must be same Mod id.

ÔºíÔºéYou should use **ModEvent**‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì to process your mod. And use **ModMain**‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë to config your mod.

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/e8da9fd1-89d0-4870-ace4-b7153dace9f2)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1c364b-daf4-41c6-aa78-f39b2fcf9d6e)

ÔºìÔºé`Cache` and register a event.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42549f20-dcd7-49b0-b624-5caae73ae1d6)

If **CacheType**=Global then, the event will be created when start game (application).

If **CacheType**=Local then, the event will be created when load save.

If **WorkOn**=Global then, the event will be deleted when load save.

Last, All properties of ModEvent will be cached (.json). You can ignore cache and reconstruct by **JsonIgnoreAttribute**

‚ÄªI wrote some events which i need. You can add more to ModMaster.

ÔºîÔºéFinal, you add your mod index to `_EventOrderIndex.json`

# Debug/Log

You can use DebugHelper to write a log which will be saved to ‚Üì folder.

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/7cf4688f-8890-41e7-bf0a-aa6519bbf325)

`xxx\AppData\LocalLow\guigugame\guigubahuang\mod\{MOD_ID}`

Also, you can use **TraceAttribute**/**TraceIgnoreAttribute** which catch calling method.





# Cache/Save
`
xxx\AppData\LocalLow\guigugame\guigubahuang\mod\{MOD_ID}
`

Your mod data will be saved here.





# ModConf

I hate to use **.cache**. It could not be read/write directly.

So, i wrote a snipet which i can use **.json** to edit game's conf.

Create a folder **ModConf** in **ModProject**, copy samples from below folder to **ModConf**

`Steam\steamapps\common\È¨ºË∞∑ÂÖ´Ëçí\Mod\modFQA\ÈÖçÁΩÆ‰øÆÊîπÊïôÁ®ã\ÈÖçÁΩÆÔºàÂè™ËØªÔºâJsonÊ†ºÂºè`

## ModConf - Notes

1. About filename, split by '**_**'. The last part is the name of conf.

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/a1ff96de-6850-466d-a3fd-682faf38a7f3)

2. You dont need rewrite all properties of conf. Just edit which you want.

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/7f9de987-89a8-441d-addc-a894d37ba746)

‚Äª**"__name"** is my comment.

3. Use **|** to set same value to the properties.

![image](https://github.com/4azuo/GuiGuBaHuang-ModLib/assets/11677054/cb95e58a-daf2-45f4-88d1-6ee1cb6cca1b)

4. If **"id"** exists, conf will be override. If not exists, then will be created a new one.
