Read the [tasks/auto-built-errors.log] file in the project directory and fix the errors listed in it. If there are compilation errors, fix the source code to resolve those errors. If there are no compilation errors, check the warnings and suggest source code improvements based on those warnings. After fixing the source code, run [rebuild-and-deploy.ps1] again to ensure all errors have been resolved. If errors still remain, repeat this process until there are no more errors.
